# Structuring webpages with HTML

## Process

When designing a successful website several things must be considered:

- **Target audience** - this includes things such as: age, gender, where they live, types of devices they use to browse and more.
- **Why people visit the site** - what goals or motivations bring people to the site? Reasearch? Shopping? Services?
- **What information visitors need** - knowing what goals bring visitor's to the site can help you predict what type of information you should provide.
- **How often people will visit the site** - depending on the role of the site, it may need to be updated more often. Sometimes this may affect only parts of an entire site.

## Design

Several strategies exist for designing websites. One possible progression is:

- **site mapping** - using cards representing different bits of information and arranging them in an order, grouping similar bits.
- **wireframe** - creating a black and white diagram of the webpage on paper or a whiteboard sketching in the size and layout of various elements. No colors, fonts or images should utilized here. Focus should stay on layout.
- **visual design** - using concepts such as visual hierarchy, grouping and similarity to organize and prioritize information.
- **Navigation** - navigation elements should be clear, contextual, concise and consistent.
