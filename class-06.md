# Problem Domain, Objects and the DOM

## Understanding Problem Domains

Many problem domains we face as programmers are difficult to understand. Often, these problem domains also look completely different depending on individual viewpoints.

Programmers are also routinely not given complete information about the problem domain, whihch leads to the issue of not even having the information needed to understand it.

## Programming Is Easy If You Understand...

When the problem domain is understood, dlear and concise, writing the code becomes far easier.

> Understanding is the most critical piece...

Coversely, it is difficult to solve a problem before you know what the question is.

## What can we do?

We can do one of two things:

1. Make the Problem Domain easier, simpler, less complex, etc.
   - The domain can sometimes be made easier by cutting out cases and narrowing focus to a smaller piece of the problem.
1. Get better at understanding Problem Domains.
   - We can become better at understanding problem domains, and avoid rushing to start coding before we thoroughly understand enough of the problem domain.

It may take a little more time and money to invest in understanding, but it cost significantly more to have to do things over rather than get them right the first time.
