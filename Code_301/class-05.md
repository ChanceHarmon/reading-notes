[Heroku Dev Center Getting-Started](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)

Above is a link to the Heroku Dev Center website with a step-by-step guide to getting started on Heroku with Node.js where a series of pages guides a user through a tutorial for deploying Node.js apps.

The tutorial guides the user through the following steps:

1. *Set up* 
   - This section explains how to make sure all of the required components are installed on the user's computer including:
     - heroku
     - node
     - npm
     - git
   Also, that new enough versions are installed.
1. *Prepare the app*
   - This section helps the user prepare a sample application to be deployed to Heroku.
     The user clones a functioning Git repository to acquire a working sample application.
1. *Deploy the app*
   - The user is instructed to create an app on Heroku and also a git remote associated with their local git repository. 
     - the app is randomly named unless a parameter is given to specify one
     - the code is then deployed by push it to heroku
     - the user ensures that an instance of the app is running and then visits the website
1. *View logs*
   - The user then learns how to view information about their running app and how to view message logs.
