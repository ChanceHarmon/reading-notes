### Web Servers
Web servers are specialized computers that host websites. They are optimized to send out web pages and are constantly connected to the internet. They are most commonly maintained by **web hosting** companies.

## Websites

All websites use **HTML** *(HyperText Markup Language)* and **CSS** *(Cascading Style Sheets)*. Many websites also incorporate **JavaScript** to give them functionality or make them dynamic. Content management systems, blogging software and e-commerce platforms routinely make use of additional elements/technologies in their websites.

All websites have a unique *IP address* associated with them and the server they are located on. Domain Name System (DNS) servers are repositories for all of these addresses and they function similarly to phone book listings to direct browsers to the correct location of the website..
