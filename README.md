## Growth Mindset

I view a **growth mindset** versus a **fixed mindset** as the equivalent of a "Nurture vs. Nature" take on intelligence and learning. In my opinion, it's not what you start with, but what you *choose* to do with it and make of it.

### A few keys to maintaining a growth mindset.
- Failing is a key part of learning
- When facing an obstacle challenge yourself to step back and find a way to:
  - Go over it
  - Go around it
  - Go under it
  - Remove it
- Criticism is just feedback. Stay positive and use it to learn more
