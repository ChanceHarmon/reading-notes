### About Me

My experience was built in the manufacturing field where I developed proficiency serving in process improvement as well as cause and corrective action task forces. But, after years in that industry, I determined that I wanted an opportunity to transition into a field that was more personally fulfilling and that I was more enthusiastic about. I decided on software development because I have always been fascinated by it and I finally stopped telling myself that I could not learn to do it. The skill set that I am building can be applied to a vast and varied range of fields. I believe that my background in both process improvement and in C & CA analysis skills will be valuable resources to any software development role I take. However, I would love to be connected to the game industry in some way, perhaps helping to design apps for cooperative board games or even game apps or video games. I would love the opportunity to contribute to the game industry because games foster in their players skills such as: problem-solving, critical thinking, resource management, risk assessment and social skills. I believe that my background in both process improvement and in C & CA analysis skills will be valuable resources to any software development role I take.
