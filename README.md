### My name is William Moreno.

_...but you can call me "Bill"._

### About Me

I have over 20 combined years of experience in both the aerospace and trucking manufacturing
fields, including team leadership roles. During that time, I also coordinated with management, engineers,
quality assurance and process improvement personnel to ensure safety, reduce defects and improve
processes and efficiency within my areas of responsibility.

I am now in the process of retraining to transition into a career in the software
development/engineering industry, where I believe my attention to detail and experience driving out defects
and improving processes will be an asset. I am currently focused on HTML, CSS and JavaScript and
debating between specializing in Full-Stack JavaScript or Python.
