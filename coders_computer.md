# Text Editors
---
A text editor is one of a coder's most important and used tools. Their are a variety of choices for a text editor. Each with differing pros and cons. By and large however, the choice of which text editor a developer uses to write their code is largely a matter of personal preference.

## Types of Text Editors

There are three basic divisions of text editors. They consist of:

- Preloaded text editors that come as part of an Operating System. These are typically bare-bones text editors that have few to no added features to make writing code easier and more efficient. Examples are: 
  - Text Edit -Mac
  - Notepad -Windows
  - Gedit (for instance) -Linux
- Third-Party text editors downloaded (often for free) from the web. The grand majority of these are free to download. Though, some do require purchase. They will most usually have most, if not all, of the more desirable features. Examples are:
  - Brackets
  - Notepad++
  - Atom
  - BB Edit
- **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironments (**IDE**).
  - Microsoft Visual Studio
  - NetBeans
  - PyCharm
