## Forms

> The best known *form* on the web is probably the search box that sits right in the middle of Google's homepage.

Forms are used for many other things besides conducting a search, however. Some of them are:
- registering for memberships
- shopping online
- signing up for newsletters and mailing lists

There are several types of form controls that you can use to collect information from site visitors:
- Adding Text
  - **Text Input *(single-line)*** - Used for a single line of text such as an email address or name
  - **Password Input** - Like a single line text box, but it masks the characters entered
  - **Text Area *(multi-lines)*** - For longer text entries like messages or comments
- Making Choices
  - **Radio Buttons** - For use when a user must select one of a number of options
  - **Checkboxes** - When a user can select and unselect one or more options
  - **Drop-down Boxes** - When a user must pick one of a number of options from a list
- Submitting Forms
  - **Submit Buttons** - To submit data from your form to another web page
  - **Image Buttons** - Similar to submit buttons but they allow you to use an image
- Uploading Files
  - **File Upload** - Allows users to upload files to a website
