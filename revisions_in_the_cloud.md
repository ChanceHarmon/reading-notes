## Version Control
Version Control Systems(VCS) are systems that allow developers to:
1. Track modifications to files
1. Compare changes made to files
1. Revert files or projects to previous versions
1. Easily rectify mistakes made in modifications

In the past, programmers utilized Local Version Control(LVC), which consisted of a database on a single computer that kept a record of chages to files. This approach was not conducive to collaboration however. The use of Centralized Version Control Systems(CVCS) emerged to not only make the collaboration process more viable but also to streamlined it as well. The database of changes to files was kept on a server which individual programmers could access. The issue with CVCS was that it was vulnerable. If the server went down or suffered corruption, programmers could not collaborate with no back up files data would be lost. CVCS were eventually replaced by Distributed Version Control Systems(DVCS) in order to address this vulnerability. To prevent catastrophic data losses DVCS allow the creation of mirrored repositories by clients. Git is one such DVCS. Since 2005, Git has become one of the most utilized VCS in the world.

# Git

Some of the benefits of Git are:
- Stores data in a file system in a series of snapshots
- Relies on local operations that allows project work to continue when not online
- Tracks every change made to files or directories
- Detects file corruption or loss of information
- Greatly minimizes the possibility of irreversible damage to files and data loss

## States

Files in Git exist in three main states:
- ### Committed
  - Data is securely stored in a local database.
- ### Modified
  - File has been changed but not committed to the database.
- ### Staged
  - Flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot.
  
### Initial Configuration

After installing Git, it should be configured using `$ git config`.
