## Version Control
Version Control Systems(VCS) are systems that allow developers to:
1. Track modifications to files
1. Compare changes made to files
1. Revert files or projects to previous versions
1. Easily rectify mistakes made in modifications

In the past, programmers utilized Local Version Control(LVC), which consisted of a database on a single computer that kept a record of chages to files. This approach was not conducive to collaboration however. The use of Centralized Version Control Systems(CVCS) emerged to not only make the collaboration process more viable but also to streamlined it as well. The database of changes to files was kept on a server which individual programmers could access. The issue with CVCS was that it was vulnerable. If the server went down or suffered corruption, programmers could not collaborate with no back up files data would be lost. CVCS were eventually replaced by Distributed Version Control Systems(DVCS) in order to address this vulnerability.
